# Setup OpenIndiana on VirtualBox
*From zero to Illumos in ten minutes*

### Install Virtualbox
[Download Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for whatever

by Oracle. The irony...

### Download OpenIndiana
[Download OpenIndiana](https://www.openindiana.org/download/). I suggest the
minimal install, as that takes up the least space. The rest of this guide will
walk you through setting up what packages you need to run the lessons.
